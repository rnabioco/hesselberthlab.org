                  nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which degrades transcripts

                  importance of nonsense variants, transcript-specific and
                  context-dependent variations in NMD activity remain poorly
                  understood. Here, we show that the amino acid preceding the
                  PTC strongly influences NMD activity. Glycine codons promote
                  robust NMD efficiency and show striking enrichment before PTCs
                  but are depleted before normal termination codons. Glycine-PTC
                  enrichment is particularly pronounced in genes tolerant to
                  loss-of-function variants, suggesting efficient elimination of
                  truncated proteins from nonessential genes. We further
                  demonstrate that the peptide release rate during translation
                  termination is an important determinant of NMD activity. We
                  propose a "window of opportunity" model where translation

              chylomicrons get into the intestinal lymphatics is unknown. Here
              we demonstrated that GPR182, a receptor in lymphatic endothelial

              uniquely poor long-term outcomes with increased recurrence risk,
              suggesting endocrine response and ER function are unique in ILC.
              We previously found specifically in ILC cells that ER is
              co-regulated by the DNA repair protein Mediator of DNA Damage
              Checkpoint 1 (MDC1). This novel MDC1 activity, however, was
              associated with dysfunction in the canonical DNA repair activity
              of MDC1, but absent typical features of DNA repair deficiency. To
              understand reciprocal activities of MDC1, we profiled the MDC1
              interactome and found MDC1-associated proteins in ILC cells mirror
              a "BRCA-like" state lacking key homologous recombination (HR)
              proteins, consistent with HR dysfunction but distinct from classic
              "BRCAness". HR dysfunction in ILC cells was mirrored in
              single-cell transcriptome and DNA repair activity analyses, along
              with DNA repair signaling and functional data, showing
              dysfunctional HR induction and resolution. In parallel, ILC tumor
              data are consistent with a distinct form of HR dysfunction via
              impaired HR resolution, lacking BRCA-like genomic scarring but
              with elevated signatures of PARP inhibitor sensitivity. We tested
              whether this HR dysfunction could indeed be exploited using PARP
              inhibition and found that talazoparib treatment produced a durable
              growth suppression in vitro and in multiple ILC xenografts in
              vivo. ILC-specific ER:MDC1 activity creates a new context for ER
              and MDC1 function in ILC, at the cost of a DNA repair dysfunction
              that is therapeutically targetable.},

Nanopore sequencing is an emerging technology with promise for both tRNA sequencing and the detection of RNA modifications; however, such studies have been limited by the throughput and accuracy of direct RNA sequencing methods. Moreover, detection of the complete set of tRNA modifications by nanopore sequencing remains challenging. Here we show that recent updates to nanopore direct RNA sequencing chemistry (RNA004) combined with our own optimizations to tRNA sequencing protocols and analysis workflows enable high throughput coverage of tRNA molecules and characterization of nanopore signals produced by 43 distinct RNA modifications. We share best practices and protocols for nanopore sequencing of tRNA and further report successful detection of low abundance mitochondrial and viral tRNAs, providing proof of concept for use of nanopore sequencing to study tRNA populations in the context of infection and organelle biology.

              that prevents the accumulation of harmful truncated proteins by
              degrading transcripts with premature termination codons (PTCs).
              NMD efficiency varies across many contexts, but the factors that
              influence this variability remain poorly understood. Here, we
              find an enrichment of glycine (Gly) codons preceding a PTC in
              common nonsense variants in contrast with a depletion of Gly
              codons preceding a normal termination codon (NTC). Gly-PTC
              contexts have higher NMD activity compared to an alanine-PTC
              context, and this effect is stronger on NMD substrates with long
              3'UTRs. We used a massively parallel reporter assay to test all
              possible combinations of -2 and -1 codons, the PTC, and the +4
              nucleotide to assess comprehensively how PTC sequence context
              affects NMD efficiency. A random forest classifier revealed that
              peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis rate during translation termination was
              the most important feature in discriminating high and low NMD
              activity. We show with in vitro biochemical assays that Gly-TC
              contexts have the slowest termination rate compared to other
              codons. Furthermore, Gly-PTC enrichment is most pronounced in
              genes that tolerate loss-of-function variants, suggesting that
              enhanced NMD of Gly-PTC context has shaped the evolution of PTCs.
              Based on these findings, we propose that NMD efficiency is
              modulated by the ``window of opportunity'' offered by peptidyl
              tRNA hydrolysis rate and thus, translation termination kinetics.",

              unprecedented view into biological processes and their regulation
              over the past 2 decades, fueling a wave of development of high
              throughput methods based on short read DNA and RNA sequencing.
              For nucleic acid modifications, NGS has been coupled with
              immunoprecipitation, chemical treatment, enzymatic treatment,
              and/or the use of reverse transcriptase enzymes with fortuitous
              activities to enrich for and to identify covalent modifications
              of RNA and DNA. However, the majority of nucleic acid
              modifications lack commercial monoclonal antibodies, and mapping
              techniques that rely on chemical or enzymatic treatments to
              manipulate modification signatures add additional technical
              complexities to library preparation. Moreover, such approaches
              tend to be specific to a single class of RNA or DNA modification,
              and generate only indirect readouts of modification status. Third
              generation sequencing technologies such as the commercially
              available ``long read'' platforms from Pacific Biosciences and
              Oxford Nanopore Technologies are an attractive alternative for
              high throughput detection of nucleic acid modifications. While
              the former can indirectly sense modified nucleotides through
              changes in the kinetics of reverse transcription reactions,
              nanopore sequencing can in principle directly detect any nucleic
              acid modification that produces a signal distortion as the
              nucleic acid passes through a nanopore sensor embedded within a
              charged membrane. To date, more than a dozen endogenous DNA and
              RNA modifications have been interrogated by nanopore sequencing,

              in metabolic labeling, structure probing, and other emerging
              applications. This review is intended to introduce the reader to
              nanopore sequencing and key principles underlying its use in
              direct detection of nucleic acid modifications in unamplified DNA
              or RNA samples, and outline current approaches for detecting and
              quantifying nucleic acid modifications by nanopore sequencing. As
              this technology matures, we anticipate advances in both

              mRNAs, altering their stability and translational efficiency.
              While APA analysis has been applied broadly in mixed populations
              of cells, the heterogeneity of APA among single cells has only
              recently begun to be explored. We developed an approach we termed
              scraps (Single Cell RNA PolyA Site Discovery), implemented as a
              user-friendly, scalable, and reproducible end-to-end workflow, to
              identify polyadenylation sites at near-nucleotide resolution in
              single cells using 10X Genomics and other TVN-primed single-cell
              RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) libraries. Our approach, which performs best
              with long (>100bp) read 1 sequencing and paired alignment to the
              genome, is both unbiased relative to existing methods that
              utilize only read 2 and recovers more sites at higher resolution,
              despite the reduction in read quality observed on most modern DNA
              sequencers following homopolymer stretches. For libraries
              sequenced without long read 1, we implement a fallback approach
              using read 2-only alignments that performs similarly to our
              optimal approach, but recovers far fewer polyadenylation sites
              per experiment. scraps also enables assessment of internal
              priming capture events, which we demonstrate occur commonly but
              at higher frequency during apoptotic 3' RNA decay. We also
              provide an R package, scrapR, that integrates the results of the
              scaps pipeline with the popular Seruat single-cell analysis
              package. Refinement and expanded application of these approaches
              will further clarify the role of APA in single cells, as well as

              drain via the lymph and are rapidly captured by MARCO+ lymphatic
              endothelial cells (LECs) in the draining lymph node (dLN),
              limiting viral spread to the bloodstream. Upon reaching the
              bloodstream, alphavirus particles are cleared from the
              circulation by MARCO-expressing Kupffer cells in the liver,
              limiting viremia and further viral dissemination. MARCO-mediated
              accumulation of alphavirus particles in the draining lymph node
              and liver is an important host defense mechanism as viremia and
              viral tissue burdens are elevated in MARCO-/- mice and disease is
              more severe. In contrast to prior studies implicating a key role

              the hibernator orchestrates and survives these extremes while

              enhance the genome integrity and annotation of a model
              hibernator, the 13-lined ground squirrel. Our new assembly brings
              this genome to near chromosome-level contiguity and adds
              thousands of previously unannotated genes. These new genomic
              resources were used to identify 6,505 hibernation-related,
              differentially-expressed and processed transcripts using RNA-seq
              data from three brain regions in animals whose physiological
              status was precisely defined using body temperature telemetry. A
              software tool, squirrelBox, was developed to foster further data

              toolset for rapid visualization of gene level and cluster group
              dynamics, sequence scanning of k-mer and domains, and interactive

              deconvolute seasonal from temperature-dependent effects on the

              highlighting the importance of carefully timed samples for

              neoplastic and immune cell diversity on MB biology in patient
              samples and animal models. METHODS: To better characterize
              cellular heterogeneity in MB we used single-cell RNA sequencing,
              immunohistochemistry and deconvolution of transcriptomic data to
              profile neoplastic and immune populations in patient samples and
              animal models across childhood MB subgroups. RESULTS: Neoplastic
              cells cluster primarily according to individual sample of origin
              which is influenced by chromosomal copy number variance. Harmony
              alignment reveals novel MB subgroup/subtype-associated
              subpopulations that recapitulate neurodevelopmental processes,
              including photoreceptor and glutamatergic neuron-like cells in
              molecular subgroups GP3 and GP4, and a specific nodule-associated
              neuronally-differentiated subpopulation in subgroup molecular
              SHH. We definitively chart the spectrum of MB immune cell
              infiltrates, which include subpopulations that recapitulate
              developmentally-related neuron-pruning and antigen presenting
              myeloid cells. MB cellular diversity matching human samples is
              mirrored in subgroup-specific mouse models of MB. CONCLUSIONS:
              These findings provide a clearer understanding of the diverse

  abstract = "After transcription of a eukaryotic pre-mRNA, its introns are
              removed by the spliceosome, joining exons for translation. The
              intron products of splicing have long been considered 'junk' and
              destined only for destruction. But because they are large in size
              and under weak selection constraints, many introns have been
              evolutionarily repurposed to serve roles after splicing. Some
              spliced introns are precursors for further processing of other
              encoded RNAs such as small nucleolar RNAs, microRNAs, and long
              noncoding RNAs. Other intron products have long half-lives and
              can be exported to the cytoplasm, suggesting that they have roles
              in translation. Some viruses encode introns that accumulate after
              splicing and play important but mysterious roles in viral
              latency. Turnover of most lariat-introns is initiated by cleavage
              of their internal 2'-5' phosphodiester bonds by a unique
              debranching endonuclease, and the linear products are further
              degraded by exoribonucleases. However, several introns appear to
              evade this turnover pathway and the determinants of their
              stability are largely unknown. Whereas many stable intron
              products were discovered serendipitously, new experimental and
              computational tools will enable their direct identification and
              study. Finally, the origins and mechanisms of mobility of
              eukaryotic introns are mysterious, and mechanistic studies of the
              intron life cycle may yield new insights into how they arose and
              became widespread.",

              homology to Dbr1 but lacks essential active site residues found
              in Dbr1. Whereas loss of Dbr1 results in lariat-introns failing

              However, current ligation-based RNA capture methods require RNA
              substrates with terminal 3'-hydroxyl groups, limiting their
              utility for identifying RNAs with modified termini like

              generated by endonucleolytic cleavages and self-cleaving

              replication in all eukaryotes and is a target for cancer therapy,
              it has never been localized in cells. Recently, a novel molecular
              genomic method used by our laboratory to localize Cdc7 to regions
              of chromosomes. Originally, mutations in the CDC7 gene were found
              in the classic cdc mutant collection of Hartwell et al. (Genetics
              74:267-286, 1973). The CDC7 gene was found to encode a protein
              kinase called DDK that has been studied for many years,
              establishing its precise role in the initiation of DNA
              replication at origins. Recently, clinical studies are underway
              with DDK inhibitors against DDK in cancer patients. However, the
              conundrum is that Cdc7 has never been detected at origins of
              replication even though many studies have suggested it should be
              there. We used ``Calling Card'' system in which DNA binding
              proteins are localized to the genome via retrotransposon
              insertion and deep-sequencing methods. We have shown that Cdc7
              localizes at many regions of the genome and was enriched at
              functional origins of replication. These results are consistent
              with DDK's role in many additional genomic processes including
              mutagenesis, chromatid cohesion, and meiotic recombination. Thus,
              the main conclusion from our studies is that Cdc7 kinase is found
              at many locations in the genome, but is enriched at functional
              origins of replication. Furthermore, we propose that application
              of the Calling Card system to other eukaryotes should be useful
              in identification of functional origins in other eukaryotic

              synaptic activity in specific brain regions, the enhancer-trap

              decreased fat upon neuronal activation. Unbiased sequencing
              revealed that Arc1 mRNA levels increase upon E347 activation. We

              We find that Arc1-expressing cells neighbor E347 neurons, and

              regulatory subunit, Dbf4, and a catalytic subunit, Cdc7, is
              essential for DNA replication initiation during S phase of the
              cell cycle through MCM2-7 helicase phosphorylation. The
              biological significance of DDK is well characterized, but the
              full mechanism of how DDK associates with substrates remains
              unclear. Cdc7 is bound to chromatin in the Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae genome throughout the cell cycle, but there is little
              empirical evidence as to specific Cdc7 binding locations. Using
              biochemical and genetic techniques, this study investigated the
              specific localization of Cdc7 on chromatin. The Calling Cards
              method, using Ty5 retrotransposons as a marker for DNA-protein
              binding, suggests Cdc7 kinase is preferentially bound to genomic
              DNA known to replicate early in S phase, including centromeres
              and origins of replication. We also discovered Cdc7 binding
              throughout the genome, which may be necessary to initiate other
              cellular processes, including meiotic recombination and
              translesion synthesis. A kinase dead Cdc7 point mutation
              increases the Ty5 retrotransposon integration efficiency and a
              55-amino acid C-terminal truncation of Cdc7, unable to bind Dbf4,
              reduces Cdc7 binding suggesting a requirement for Dbf4 to
              stabilize Cdc7 on chromatin during S phase. Chromatin
              immunoprecipitation demonstrates that Cdc7 binding near specific
              origins changes during S phase. Our results suggest a model where
              Cdc7 is loosely bound to chromatin during G1 At the G1/S

              identification is critical. RESULTS: We found that substantial
              mispriming during reverse transcription results in the
              overrepresentation of sequences complementary to the primer used
              for reverse transcription. Up to 45 \% of peaks in publicly

              Installation of xrRNAs ahead of a downstream internal ribosome

               expand the complexity of the transcriptome. In ectothermic
               organisms, including Drosophila and Cephalopoda, where body
               temperature mirrors ambient temperature, decreases in
               environmental temperature lead to increases in A-to-I RNA
               editing and cause amino acid recoding events that are thought to
               be adaptive responses to temperature fluctuations. In contrast,
               endothermic mammals, including humans and mice, typically
               maintain a constant body temperature despite environmental
               changes. Here, A-to-I editing primarily targets repeat elements,
               rarely results in the recoding of amino acids, and plays a
               critical role in innate immune tolerance. Hibernating ground
               squirrels provide a unique opportunity to examine RNA editing in
               a heterothermic mammal whose body temperature varies over 30C
               and can be maintained at 5C for many days during torpor. We
               profiled the transcriptome in three brain regions at six
               physiological states to quantify RNA editing and determine
               whether cold-induced RNA editing modifies the transcriptome as a
               potential mechanism for neuroprotection at low temperature
               during hibernation. We identified 5165 A-to-I editing sites in
               1205 genes with dynamically increased editing after prolonged
               cold exposure. The majority (99.6\%) of the cold-increased
               editing sites are outside of previously annotated coding
               regions, 82.7\% lie in SINE-derived repeats, and 12 sites are
               predicted to recode amino acids. Additionally, A-to-I editing
               frequencies increase with increasing cold-exposure,
               demonstrating that ADAR remains active during torpor. Our
               findings suggest that dynamic A-to-I editing at low body
               temperature may provide a neuroprotective mechanism to limit

               type 1 interferon-mediated antiviral defenses and by viral
               countermeasures to these defenses. When IAV NS1 protein is
               disabled, RNase L restricts virus replication; however, the RNAs
               targeted for cleavage by RNase L under these conditions have not
               been defined. In this study, we used deep-sequencing methods to
               identify RNase L cleavage sites within host and viral RNAs from
               IAV PR8$\Delta$NS1-infected A549 cells. Short hairpin RNA
               knockdown of RNase L allowed us to distinguish between RNase
               L-dependent and RNase L-independent cleavage sites. RNase
               L-dependent cleavage sites were evident at discrete locations in
               IAV RNA segments (both positive and negative strands). Cleavage
               in PB2, PB1, and PA genomic RNAs suggests that viral RNPs are
               susceptible to cleavage by RNase L. Prominent amounts of
               cleavage mapped to specific regions within IAV RNAs, including
               some areas of increased synonymous-site conservation. Among
               cellular RNAs, RNase L-dependent cleavage was most frequent at
               precise locations in rRNAs. Our data show that RNase L targets
               specific sites in both host and viral RNAs to restrict influenza
               virus replication when NS1 protein is disabled. IMPORTANCE:
               RNase L is a critical component of interferon-regulated and
               double-stranded-RNA-activated antiviral host responses. We
               sought to determine how RNase L exerts its antiviral activity
               during influenza virus infection. We enhanced the antiviral
               activity of RNase L by disabling a viral protein, NS1, that
               inhibits the activation of RNase L. Then, using deep-sequencing
               methods, we identified the host and viral RNAs targeted by RNase
               L. We found that RNase L cleaved viral RNAs and rRNAs at very
               precise locations. The direct cleavage of IAV RNAs by RNase L
               highlights an intimate battle between viral RNAs and an
               antiviral endonuclease.",

  abstract = "RNA repair enzymes catalyze rejoining of an RNA molecule after
              cleavage of phosphodiester linkages. RNA repair in budding yeast
              is catalyzed by two separate enzymes that process tRNA exons
              during their splicing andHAC1mRNA exons during activation of the
              unfolded protein response (UPR). The RNA ligase Trl1 joins
              2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-hydroxyl RNA fragments, creating a
              phosphodiester linkage with a 2'-phosphate at the junction. The
              2'-phosphate is removed by the 2'-phosphotransferase Tpt1. We
              bypassed the essential functions ofTRL1andTPT1in budding yeast by
              expressing ``prespliced,'' intronless versions of the 10 normally
              intron-containing tRNAs, indicating this repair pathway does not
              have additional essential functions. Consistent with previous
              studies, expression of intronless tRNAs failed to rescue the
              growth of cells with deletions in components of the SEN complex,
              implying an additional essential role for the splicing

              tRNA andHAC1splicing intermediates indicative of RNA repair

              Failure to induce the unfolded protein response intrl1$\Delta$
              cells grown with tunicamycin is lethal owing to their inability
              to ligateHAC1after its cleavage by Ire1. In contrast,tpt1$\Delta$
              mutants grow in the presence of tunicamycin despite reduced
              accumulation of splicedHAC1mRNA. We optimized a PCR-based method
              to detect RNA 2'-phosphate modifications and show they are
              present on ligatedHAC1mRNA. These RNA repair mutants enable new

              decreased lifespan. RtcB also ligates endogenous pre-tRNA halves,

              bypassed by expression of pre-spliced tRNAs. In addition, animals
