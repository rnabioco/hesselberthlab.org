ü§ù **Our Mission.** We are a collaborative research laboratory comprising RNA biologists, technology developers, and data analysts
focused on discovering and translating fundamental principles of RNA regulation.

üß¨ **Core Research.** Our major focus in the lab is to understand protein translation through the lens
of transfer RNA (tRNA). Transfer RNAs link the RNA and protein worlds, and our
newest approaches apply nanopore sequencing technologies to understand the dynamic use of tRNA across
multiple steps in protein translation.

üíä **Clinical Applications.** Our newest efforts focus on RNA therapeutics. We work with
clinicians at Children's Hospital Colorado to develop RNA therapies for
pediatric genetic diseases (lately focused on retinopathies), and with immunologists and virologists to
develop new ways to manipulate and understand the mammalian immune system.
